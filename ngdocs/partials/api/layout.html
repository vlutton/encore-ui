<p>Encore UI includes a grid system forked from
<a href="https://material.angularjs.org/#/layout/container">Angular Material&#39;s layout module</a>
with minor usability enhancements to provide an assortment of attribute-based
layout options based on the flexbox layout model. Included are intuitive attribute
based styles that ease the creation of responsive row and/or column based page layouts.</p>
<h3 id="layout-component_note-about-responsive-features">Note About Responsive Features</h3>
<p>Two versions of the Encore UI CSS file are included in this project. One includes
responsive design style attributes (encore-ui-resp-x.x.x.css). The other omits
these attributes to save space if desired (encore-ui-x.x.x.css). Be sure to only
include the appropriate css file for your project. Any attributes which include
the following suffixes require the responsive css file to work:
&#39;-sm&#39;, &#39;-gt-sm&#39;, &#39;-md&#39;, &#39;-gt-md&#39;, &#39;-lg&#39;, &#39;-gt-lg&#39;.</p>
