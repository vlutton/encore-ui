[API Documentation](/ngdocs/index.html#/api/rxRadio.directive:rxRadio)

rxRadio is an **attribute directive** that wraps a native radio element in markup required for styling purposes.
To use the directive, you can replace `type="radio"` with `rx-radio`. The directive is smart enough to set
the correct input type.

## Styling

* Directive results in an **inline-block element**
* You can style the output against decendents of the **`.rxRadio`** CSS class.

## Show/Hide

If you wish to show/hide your `rxRadio` element (and its label), we recommend placing the element (and its label)
inside of a `<div>` or `<span>` wrapper, and performing the show/hide logic on the wrapper.

```html
<span ng-show="isShown">
  <input rx-radio id="radDemo" ng-model="radDemo" />
  <label for="radDemo">Label for Demo Radio</label>
</span>
```

It is highly recommended that you use `ng-show` and `ng-hide` for display logic. Because of the way that `ng-if` and `ng-switch`
directives behave with scope, they may introduce unnecessary complexity in your code.
