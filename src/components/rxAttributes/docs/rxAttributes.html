<!-- Sample HTML goes here as a live example of how to the component can be used -->
<div ng-controller="rxAttributesCtrl">
    <p><strong>The following content gets replaced by the value of ng-bind. It also gets some styles applied to it:</strong></p>
    <p rx-attributes="{'ng-bind': customContent, 'style': customStyles}">Content that's replaced</p>

    <p><strong>The following content doesn't get replaced, since 'nothing' isn't a property on the scope:</strong></p>
    <p rx-attributes="{'ng-bind': nothing}">Non-replaced content</p>

    <p><strong>The following content (you can't see it) does get replaced, but by nothing, since 'nothing' isn't a property on the scope. This is what rx-attributes avoids</strong></p>
    <p ng-bind="nothing">Content that's unintentionally replaced</p>
</div>
