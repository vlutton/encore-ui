/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name rxModalAction.directive:rxModalAction
 * @restrict E
 * @scope
 * @description
 * Link which will show a modal window on click, and handle callbacks for pre/post modal actions
 *
 * # Template URL
 *
 * Due to the complex nature of the information passed into modal windows, HTML is handled via a template (versus
 * transcluding the content).
 *
 * One benefit is that this allows for multiple actions to re-use the same template. It also allows modal content to
 * live in a separate file, which can be helpful for maintainability if the modal HTML is complex. While this can be
 * done via `ng-include`, it would be a little extra work for a common scenario.
 *
 * # Hooks
 *
 * `rxModalAction` allows you to define functions to be called at different points of the modal lifecycle.  These hooks
 * are optional and the modal window is fully functional without any being defined.
 *
 * ## Pre-hook
 *
 * The `pre-hook` function is called before the modal window is shown.  Use a this to populate field information inside
 * of the modal.  This is useful when you have information you don't want loaded when the page is first opened, but do
 * need for the modal.  It is also useful for dynamic information that is based on actions taken.
 *
 * ## Post-hook
 *
 * The `post-hook` function is called after the modal is submitted.  A `post-hook` is useful to take actions based upon
 * input in the modal.  For example, you can use the user input that gets entered to send API requests with specific
 * JSON data.  Or you can simply run a pre-defined API call (assuming the modal is a simple confirmation dialog).
 *
 * ## Dismiss-hook
 *
 * The `dismiss-hook` function is called after the modal is closed without submitting.  This may happen via any of the
 * following scenarios:
 *
 * * Clicking the "Cancel" button
 * * Clicking the "X" button in the top right
 * * Pressing `ESC`
 * * Explicitly calling `$modalInstance.dismiss()` in your javascript logic
 *
 * This hook is useful for making changes to UI state when the user wants to cancel the given action.  For example, you
 * may use this to return an indeterminate component to a previous state (e.g. toggle switches).
 *
 * @param {Function=} [preHook] Function to call when a modal is opened
 * @param {Function=} [postHook] Function to call when a modal is submitted (not called when cancelled out of)
 * @param {Function=} [dismissHook] Function to call when a modal is dismissed (not called when submitted)
 * @param {String=} [templateUrl] URL of template to use for modal content
 * @param {*=} [disable-esc] If the `disable-esc` attribute is present, then "Press Esc to close" will be disabled
 *                           for the modal. This attribute takes no values.
 * @param {Expression=} [disabled=false] the `disabled` attribute takes an expression. If expression is present,
 *                      then link for opening modal will be disabled.
 *
 * @example
 * <pre>
 * <rx-modal-action
 *     pre-hook="myPreHook(this)"
 *     post-hook="myPostHook(fields)"
 *     template-url="modalContent.html"
 *     disable-esc>
 *         My Link Text
 * </rx-modal-action>
 * </pre>
