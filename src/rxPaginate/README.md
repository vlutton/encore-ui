Used for adding pagination to a table.

Two different forms of pagination are supported:

 1. UI-based pagination, where all items are retrieved at once, and paginated in the UI
 2. Server-side pagination, where the pagination directive works with a paginated API


# UI-Based Pagination
With UI-Based pagination, the entire set of data is looped over via an `ngRepeat` in the table's `<tbody>`, with the data passed into the `Paginate` filter. This filter does the work of paginating the set of data and communicating with the `<rx-paginate>` to draw the page selection buttons at the bottom of the table.

As shown in the first example below, the `ngRepeat` will usually look like this:

```
 <tr ng-repeat="server in servers | orderBy: sorter.predicate:sorter.reverse | Paginate:pager ">
```

In this case, 

 1. `servers` is a variable bound to your page `$scope`, and contains the full set of servers. 
 2. This is then passed to `orderBy`, to perform column sorting with `rxSortableColumn`. 
 3. The sorted results are then passed to `Paginate:pager`, where `Paginate` is a filter from the `rxPaginate` module, and `pager` is a variable on your scope created like `$scope.pager = PageTracking.createInstance();`. 
 
This `pager` is responsible for tracking pagination state (i.e. "which page are we on", "how many items per page", "total number of items tracked", etc.

To add the pagination buttons to your table, do the following in your `<tfoot>`:

```
<tfoot>
    <tr class="paginate-area">
        <td colspan="2">
            <rx-paginate page-tracking="pager"></rx-paginate>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tfoot>
```

Here we are using the `<rx-paginate>` directive to draw the buttons, passing it the same `pager` instance described above.

Because all of the `servers` get passed via `ng-repeat`, it means you don't need to take explicit action if the set of data changes. You can change `$scope.servers` at any time, and `<rx-paginate>` will automatically re-process it.

## Persistence

The user's preference for the number of items to display per page will be persisted across applications using localstorage. This preference is set whenever the user selects a new number to show.

This applies to both UI-based pagination and API-based pagination.

*NOTE*: If `itemsPerPage` is explicitly specified in the `opts` you pass to `PageTracking.createInstance()`, then that pager instance will load using the `itemsPerPage` you specified, and _not_ the globally persisted value.

*NOTE*: If you don't want a specific pager to have its `itemsPerPage` persisted to other pagers, pass `persistItemsPerPage: false` with the `opts` to `createInstance()`.

## Hiding the pagination

In some instances, the pagination should be hidden if there isn't enough data to require it. For example, if you have `itemsPerPage` set to 10, but only have 7 items of data (so only one page). Hiding the pagination is pretty simple:

    <rx-paginate page-tracking="pager" ng-hide="pager.totalPages === 1"></rx-paginate>

You can use this code on any part of your view. For example, if you have pagination in your table footer, it's a good idea to hide the entire footer:

    <tfoot ng-hide="pager.totalPages === 1">
        <tr class="paginate-area">
            <td colspan="12">
                <rx-paginate page-tracking="pager"></rx-paginate>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tfoot>

See the demo below for more examples of this.

This applies to both UI-based pagination and API-based pagination.

# API-Based Pagination
Many APIs support pagination on their own. Previously, we would have to grab _all_ the data at once, and use the UI-Based Pagination described above. Now we have support for paginated APIs, such that we only retrieve data for given pages when necessary.

With API-based pagination, the `ngRepeat` for your table will instead look like this:

```
<tr ng-repeat="server in pagedServers.items">
```

Note a few things here:

 1. We now loop over a variable provided by the pager.
 2. We no longer pass the values through _any_ filters. Not a search text filter, not sorting filter, and not the `Paginate` filter.

** BEGIN WARNING ** 

You should _never_ access `pagedServers.items` from anywhere other than the `ng-repeat`. Do not touch it in your controller. It is a dynamic value that can
change at anytime. It is only intended for use by `ng-repeat`.

** END WARNING ** 

The `<tfoot>` will look like this:

```
<tfoot>
    <tr class="paginate-area">
        <td colspan="2">
            <rx-paginate 
                page-tracking="pagedServers"
                server-interface="serverInterface"
                filter-text="searchText"
                selections="selectFilter.selected"
                sort-column="sort.predicate"
                sort-direction="sort.reverse">
            </rx-paginate>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tfoot>
```

 * `page-tracking` still receives the pager (`pagedServers` in this case) as an argument. What's new are the next four parameters.
 * `server-interface` _must_ be present. It has to be passed an object with a `getItems()` method on it. This method is what `<rx-paginate>` will use to request data from the paginated API.
 * `filter-text`, `selections`, `sort-column` and `sort-direction` are all optional. If present, `<rx-paginate>` will watch the variables for changes, and will call `getItems()` for updates whenever the values change.

Note: If using `<rx-select-filter>` in the table, the `available` option passed to the `SelectFilter` constructor **must** be provided and include every property.  This is because the filter cannot reliably determine all available options from a paginated api.

You will still create a `PageTracking` instance on your scope, just like in UI-based pagination:

```
$scope.pagedServers = PageTracking.createInstance();
```

## getItems()
The `getItems()` method is one you write on your own, and lives as an interface between `<rx-paginate>` and the server-side paginated API that you will be calling. The framework will make calls to `getItems()` when appropriate. Rather than have to teach `<rx-paginate>` about how to call and parse a multitude of different paginated APIs, it is your responsibility to implement this generic method.

`getItems()` takes two required parameters, and one optional parameter object. When the framework calls it, it looks like:

```
getItems(pageNumber, itemsPerPage, {
    filterText: some_filter_search_text,
    selections: selected_options_from_filters,
    sortColumn: the_selected_sort_column,
    sortDirection: the_direction_of_the_sort_column
});
```

where:

 - `pageNumber`: the 0-based page of data that the user has clicked on/requested
 - `itemsPerPage`: the value the user currently has selected for how many items per page they wish to see
 - `filterText`: the filter search string entered by the user, if any
 - `selections`: an object containing the item properties and their selected options
 - `sortColumn`: the name of the selected sort column, if any
 - `sortDirection`: either `'ASCENDING'` or `'DESCENDING'`

When the framework calls `getItems()`, you **_must_ return a promise**. When this promise resolves, the resolved object must have the following properties on it:

 - `items`: An array containing the actual items/rows of the table returned for the request. This should at least contain `itemsPerPage` items, if that many items exist on the given page
 - `pageNumber`: The 0-based page number that these items belong to. Normally this should be the same as the `pageNumber` value passed to `getItems()`
 - `totalNumberOfItems`: The total number of items available, given the `filterText` parameter.

Examples are below.

## `totalNumberOfItems`

If you could get all items from the API in _one call_, `totalNumberOfItems` would reflect the number of items returned (given necessary search parameters). For example, say the following request was made:

```
var pageNumber = 0;
var itemsPerPage = 50;
getItems(pageNumber, itemsPerPage);
```

This is asking for all the items on page 0, with the user currently viewing 50 items per page. A valid response would return 50 items. However, the _total_ number of items available might be 1000 (i.e. 20 pages of results). Your response must then have `totalNumberOfItems: 1000`. This data is needed so we can display to the user "Showing 1-50 of 1000 items" in the footer of the table.

If `filterText` is present, then the total number of items might change. Say the request became:

```
var pageNumber = 0;
var itemsPerPage = 50;
var opts = {
    filterText: "Ubuntu"
};
getItems(pageNumber, itemsPerPage, opts);
```

This means "Filter all your items by the search term 'Ubuntu', then return page 0". If the total number of items matching "Ubuntu" is 200, then your response would have `totalNumberOfItems: 200`. You might only return 50 items in `.items`, but the framework needs to know how many total items are available.

## Forcing a Refresh
When using API-based pagination, there might be instances where you want to force a reload of the current items. For example, if the user takes an action to delete an item. Normally, the items in the view are only updated when the user clicks to change the page. To force a refresh, a `refresh()` method is available on the `pagedServers`. Calling this will tell `<rx-paginate>` to refresh itself. You can also pass it a `stayOnPage = true` to tell it to make a fresh request for the current page, i.e.

```
var stayOnPage = true;
pagedServers.refresh(stayOnPage);
```

Internally, calling `refresh()` equates to `<rx-paginate>` doing a new `getItems()` call, with the current filter/sort criteria. But the point is that you can't just call `getItems()` yourself to cause an update. The framework has to call that method, so it knows to wait on the returned promise.

This is shown in the demo below with a "Refresh" button above the API-paginated demo.


## Error Handling
`<rx-paginate>` includes a simple way to show error messages when `getItems()` rejects instead of resolves. By passing `error-message="Some error text!"` to `<rx-paginate>`, the string entered there will be shown in an rxNotification whenever `getItems()` fails. If `error-message` is not specified, then nothing will be shown on errors. In either case, on a failure, the table will stay on the page it was on before the request went out.

If you wish to show more complicated error messages (and it is highly recommended that you do!), then you'll have to do that yourself. Either put error handling code directly into your `getItems()`, or have something else wait on the `getItems()` promise whenever it's called, and perform the handling there. 

One way to do this is as so:

Let's say that you had defined your `getItems()` method on an object called `pageRequest`,

```
    var pageRequest = {
        getItems: function (pageNumber, itemsPerPage, opts) {
            var defer = $q.deferred();
            ...
        }
    }
```


You want your `getItems()` to be unaware of the UI, i.e. you don't want to mix API and UI logic into one method.

Instead, you could do something like this:

```
var pageRequest = {
    getItemsFromAPI: function (pageNumber, itemsPerPage, opts) {
        var defer = $q.deferred();
        ...
    }

    getItems: function (pageNumber, itemsPerPage, opts) {
        var promise = this.getItemsFromAPI(pageNumber, itemsPerPage, opts);

        rxPromiseNotifications.add(promise, {
            error: 'Error loading page ' + pageNumber
        }

        return promise;
    }
}
```

Thus we've moved the API logic into `getItemsFromAPI`, and handled the UI logic separately.

## Extra Filtering Parameters
By default, `<rx-paginate>` can automatically work with a search text field (using `search-text=`). If you need to filter by additional criteria (maybe some dropdowns/radiobox, extra filter boxes, etc), you'll need to do a bit more work on your own.

To filter by some element X, set a `$watch` on X's model. Whenever it changes, call `pagedServers.refresh()` to force `<rx-paginate>` to do a new `getItems()` call. Then, in your `getItems()`, grab the current value of X and send it out along with the normal criteria that are passed into `getItems()`. Something like:

```
$scope.watch('extraSearch', $scope.pagedServers.refresh);


var serverInterface = {
    getItems: function (pageNumber, itemsPerPage, opts) {
        var extraSearch = $scope.extraSearch;
        return callServerApi(pageNumber, itemsPerPage, opts, extraSearch);
    }
}

...

<rx-paginate server-interface="serverInterface" ... ></rx-paginate>
```

Remember that calling `refresh()` without arguments will tell `rx-paginate` to make a fresh request for page 0. If you call it with `true` as the first argument, the request will be made with whatever the current page is, i.e. `getItems(currentPage, ...)`. If you have your own search criteria, and they've changed since the last time this was called, note that the page number might now be different. i.e. If the user was on page 10, they entered some new filter text, and you call `refresh(true)`, there might not even be 10 pages of results with that filter applied.

In general, if you call `refresh(true)`, you should check if _any_ of the filter criteria have changed since the last call. If they have, you should ask for page 0 from the server, not the page number passed in to `getItems()`. If you call `refresh()` without arguments, then you don't have to worry about comparing to the last-used filter criteria.

## Local Caching

**If you are ok with a call to your API every time the user goes to a new page in the table, then you can ignore this section. If you want to reduce the total number of calls to your API, please read on.**

When a `getItems()` request is made, the framework passes in the user's `itemsPerPage` value. If it is 50, and there are 50 results available for the requested page, then you should return _at least_ 50 results. However, you may also return _more_ than 50 items. 

Initially, `<rx-paginate>` will call `getItems()`, wait for a response, and then update items in the table.  If your `getItems()` returned exactly `itemsPerPage` results in its `items` array, and the user navigates to a different page of data, `getItems()` will be called again to fetch new information from the API.  The user will then need to wait before they see new data in the table. This remains true for every interaction with page data navigation.

For example, say the following request is made when the page first loads:

```
var pageNumber = 0;
var itemsPerPage = 50;
getItems(pageNumber, itemsPerPage);
```

Because no data is available yet, `<rx-paginate>` will call `getItems()`, wait for the response, and then draw the items in the table. If you returned exactly 50 items, and the user then clicks "Next" or 2 (to go to the second page), then `getItems()` will have to be called again (`getItems(1, 50)`), and the user will have to wait for the results to come in.

However, if your `getItems()` were to pull more than `itemsPerPage` of data from the API, `<rx-paginate>` is smart enough to navigate through the saved data without needing to make an API request every time the page is changed.

There are some caveats, though.
 1. Your returned `items.length` must be a multiple of `itemsPerPage` (if `itemsPerPage = 50`, `items.length` must be 50, 100, 150, etc.)
 2. You will need to calculate the page number sent to the API based on requested values in the UI.
 3. If the user enters any search text, and you've passed the search field to `<rx-paginate>` via `search-text`, then the cache will be immediately flushed and a new request made. 
 4. If you've turned on column-sorting, and passed `sort-column` to `<rx-paginate>`, then the cache will be flushed whenever the user changes the sort, and a new request will be made to `getItems()`
 5. If you've passed `sort-direction` to `<rx-paginate>, and the user changes the sort direction, then the cache will be flushed and a new request will be made to `getItems()`

Details on this are below.

### Local Caching Formula

You have to be careful with grabbing more items than `itemsPerPage`, as you'll need to modify the values you send to your server. If you don't want to be careful, then don't ever request more than `itemsPerPage` from your API.

Let's say that `itemsPerPage` is 50, but you want to grab 200 items at a time from the server, to reduce the round-trips to your API. We'll call this 200 the `serverItemsPerPage`. First, ensure that your `serverItemsPerPage` meets this requirement:

```
(serverItemsPerPage >= itemsPerPage) && (serverItemsPerPage % itemsPerPage === 0)
```

If you're asking for 200 items at a time, the page number on the server won't match the page number requested by the user. Before, a user call for `pageNumber = 4` and `itemsPerPage = 50` means "Give me items 200-249". But if you're telling your API that each page is 200 items long, then `pageNumber = 4` is not what you want to ask your API for (it would return items 800-999!). You'll need to send a custom page number to the server. In this case, you'd need `serverPageNumber` to be `1`, i.e. the second page of results from the server.

We have written a utility function do these calculations for you, `rxPaginateUtils.calculateApiVals`. It returns an object with `serverPageNumber` and `offset` properties. To use it, your `getItems()` might look something like this. 

```
var getItems = function (pageNumber, itemsPerPage) {
    var deferred = $q.defer();

    var serverItemsPerPage = 200;

    var vals = rxPaginateUtils.calculateApiVals(pageNumber, itemsPerPage, serverItemsPerPage);
    yourRequestToAPI(vals.serverPageNumber, serverItemsPerPage)
    .then(function (items) {

        deferred.resolve({
            items: items.slice(vals.offset),
            pageNumber: pageNumber,
            totalNumberOfItems: items.totalNumberOfItems
        });

    });

    return deferred.promise;
}
```

The following tables should help illustrate what we mean with these conversions. In all three cases, there are a total of 120 items available from the API.

| pageNumber | itemsPerPage | Items   | Action     | serverPageNumber | serverItemsPerPage | Items  |
|------------|--------------|---------|------------|------------------|--------------------|--------|
| 0          | 50           | 1-50    | getItems() | 0                | 50                 | 1-50   |
| 1          | 50           | 51-100  | getItems() | 1                | 50                 | 51-100 |
| 2          | 50           | 101-120 | getItems() | 2                | 50                 | 101-120|

This first table is where you don't want to do any local caching. You send the `pageNumber` and `itemsPerPage` to your API, unchanged from what
the user requested. Every time the user clicks to go to a new page, an API request will take place.

---

|pageNumber   | itemsPerPage | Items   | Action     | serverPageNumber | serverItemsPerPage | Items |
|-------------|--------------|---------|------------|------------------|--------------------|-------|
| 0           | 50           | 1-50    | getItems() | 0                | 100                | 1-100 |
| 1           | 50           | 51-100  | use cached |                  |                    |       |
| 2           | 50           | 101-120 | getItems() | 1                | 100                |101-120|

This second example shows the case where the user is still looking at 50 `itemsPerPage`, but you want to grab 100 items at a time from your API.

When the table loads (i.e. the user wants to look at the first page of results), an "Action" of `getItems(0, 50)` will take place. Using `calculateApiVals`, the `serverPageNumber` will be 0 when you provide `serverItemsPerPage=100`. When you resolve the `getItems()` promise, you'll return items 1-100.

When the user clicks on the second page (page 1), `getItems()` will not be called, `<rx-paginate>` will instead use the values it has cached. 

When the user clicks on the third page (page 2), `getItems(2, 50)` will be called. You'll use `rxPaginateutils.calculateApiVals` to calculate that `serverPageNumber` now needs to be `1`. Because only 120 items in total are available, you'll eventually resolve the promise with `items` containing items 101-120.

---

| pageNumber | itemsPerPage | Items   | Action     | serverPageNumber | serverItemsPerPage | Items |
|------------|--------------|---------|------------|------------------|--------------------|-------|
| 0          | 50           | 1-50    | getItems() | 0                | 200                | 1-120 |
| 1          | 50           | 51-100  | use cached |                  |                    |       |
| 2          | 50           | 101-120 | use cached |                  |                    |       |

In this final example, there are still only 120 items available, but you're asking your API for 200 items at a time. This will cause an API request on the first page, but the next two pages will be cached, and `<rx-paginate>` will use the cached values.
