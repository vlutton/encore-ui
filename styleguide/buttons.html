<h3 class="title clear">Basics</h3>

<p>While buttons in EncoreUI can be marked up multiple ways: through <code>button</code>, <code>input type="button"</code> or <a href="#/components/rxButton">the rxButton directive</a>, which adds dynamic actions to loading indicators and messages - they should be styled using the <code>.button</code> class.</p>


    <h3 class="title clear">Customizing Buttons</h3>
    <div class="component-description clear">

        <p>Buttons are sized using <code>xl</code>, <code>lg</code>, <code>sm</code> and <code>xs</code> classes. Not adding the additional class defaults the size to medium.</p>

        <h2>Using Colors with Buttons</h2>

        <p><span class="msg-info">ENCORE-SPECIFIC:</span> In the context of the EncoreUI, when is a button blue and when is a button green?</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>If the form you are submitting results in CREATING or ADDING something, use green.</li>
            <li>If the form you are submitting is within a modal, use green.</li>
            <li>If the form you are submitting results in EDITING something or something auxiliary (like getting metadata from a different sources) keep it blue.</li>
            <li>If you are providing a button for the user to continue through a series of modals (with no submit), use blue.</li>
            <li>If you are providing a button for the user to exit a series of modals where no other action is required by the user, use the "Finish &amp; Close" button with a blue outline.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using Spinners with Buttons</h2>

        <p>The Framework provides a spinner style for use with buttons. Note that different spinner styles are used when content is loading or being fetched (see <a href="#colors">Using Colors and Icons With Links demo</a>).</p>
        <p>When a user takes an action with results that cannot be immediately displayed, a spinner is shown on a disabled button state until the call completes or the results of the user's action can be displayed in the UI. Text for buttons with spinners should describe the action being taken using "-ing" verbs, so the user understands why the button appearance has changed. Note that the disabled state ensures the user cannot submit the same data multiple times while the initial action completes.
        </p>

        <h2>Button Groups</h2>
        <p>This control should NOT be used as a replacement for radio inputs. Instead, it should be used to indicate state on a page. For example, the legend of a time plot may allow the user to select a range of a week, month, or year. In this situation, there is no form being submitted, but there is an indication of the graph's state that can be interacted with. Conversely, radio inputs are the correct way to implement a form input where one of a few options can be selected.</p>
        <p>Also, this type of control should only be used with at most four segments.</p>

<h3 class="title">Using Colors and Icons With Links</h2>
<div class="component-description clear">

<h2 id="colors">Colors</h2>

<p>Status Classes are used to provide a clearer status regarding a simple message. Within the context of Encore, we use the following colors to convey action links:</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li>Green (<code>.msg-action</code>) is for create/add actions. When part of a list, they appear at the top.</li>
    <li>Blue (<code>.msg-info-blue</code>) is for download actions. When part of a list, they appear second.</li>
    <li>Orange (<code>.msg-info</code>) is for edit/modify actions. When part of a list, they appear third.</li>
    <li>Red (<code>.msg-warn</code>) is for destructive actions. When part of a list, they appear last.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="msg-warn">HEADS UP:</span> Because these classes are colors, they can also be applied to regular text as well. This can cause confusion between when something is a text and something is an action. This is a design pattern discrepancy that will need to be resolved in a future iteration.</p>

<h2>Icons</h2>
<p>We use the <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> library as a way to visualize and distinguish actionable items. So far we've tried to ensure that iconography with action links remains unique to one action (with the exception of "create", "delete", "change", "edit", and "go to" actions, which use the same icons in many places regardless of context). However, in the case of two opposite actions that you can take on a single unit (for example, choosing to enable connection throttling on a load balancer when throttling is disabled, or disabling throttling when throttling is enabled), then the same icon and color can be used. In the case of opposite actions, only one action should display at a time, depending on the state. Note that any "enable" or "disable" actions should be yellow in color, as they're causing changes to something rather than creating something new (green) or destroying something (red).
</p>

<p>For the majority of Encore, actionable links are used in two places&#8212;in the upper right hand section of a details page, flushed right with the <code>page-actions</code> and <code>actions-area</code> classes, or in the rxActionMenu directive.</p>
<p>Below we have included icons that have been used throughout Encore, as well as the actions associated with the icons. Please use as a reference for which icons are already in use and should not be duplicated.</p>

<p><span class="msg-warn">HEADS UP:</span> Most icons have been chosen based on the verb (Add, Edit, Delete, Restart, etc) but there are a couple of icons chosen on the noun (consoles, tachometers for throttling). This is a design pattern discrepancy that will need to be resolved in a future iteration.</p>

<h2>Using Spinners with Action Links</h2>
<p>The Framework provides a spinner style for use with action links. Note that different spinner styles are used when a user takes action by clicking a button (see <a href="#">Buttons & Links demo</a>).</p>
<p>When an action link must first fetch data or determine state before the user can click it, a spinner is shown to the right of the action link, and both spinner and link have a disabled grey color and are not clickable.</p>
<p><span class="msg-warn">HEADS UP:</span> Note that the spinner with action link is being styled on a per-project basis currently, since the current implementation of rxSpinner needs to be updated to support this use case more easily.</p>
