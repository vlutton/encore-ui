    <ul class="list">
        <li>This sub-site provides development teams at Rackspace with a set of design patterns, to help ensure a consistent and unified look-and-feel for all products under the Encore umbrella.</li>
        <li>This section of the Demo site focuses mainly on markup, CSS and design patterns. If you're curious about Encore-specific angular.js directives, find the "All Components" section in the left hand navigation.</li>
        <li>If you're a Rackspace team outside of Encore and need help setting up an new project from an engineering perspective, go to this <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/blob/master/guides/using-encoreui.md">Using EncoreUI In Your Own Project</a> guide in the EncoreUI repository.
        <ul class="list">
            <li>For the most part, Rackspace developer teams will be creating mark-up using the <a href="#/components/rxApp">rxPage subdirective of rxApp</a> as a container.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/blob/master/src/rxApp/templates/rxPage.html">rxPage's template code</a> contains a breadcrumb component, an attribute to pre-fill titles and subtitles and a rxNotification container so you can send page-level communication errors and validation messages in a standardized way. Check the angular.js code for controllers within Cloud Encore for implementation examples.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/tree/master/src/rxApp">rxApp</a> <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/blob/master/src/rxApp/common.less">common.less file</a> defines many base CSS rules and classes for app use. Included in this is <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a>. This helps create a consistent starting point for styles across all browsers.</li>

        <li>Kevin Lamping, a developer on the EncoreUI team, wrote a document to address <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/blob/master/guides/css-styleguide.md">coding standards while writing CSS</a>.</li>

    <h3 id="flexbox-grid">Flexbox Grid</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>EncoreUI includes a grid system forked from <a target="_blank" href="https://material.angularjs.org/#/layout/container">Angular Material's layout module</a>. With minor usability enhancements, EncoreUI provides an assortment of attribute-based layout options, based on the flexbox layout model. Included are intuitive attribute based styles for responsive row and/or column based page layouts. Visit the <a href="#/components/layout">layout</a> section for info on how to use these attributes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="date-formatting">Date formatting</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Dates in any context should be formatted this way: <code>Mar 2, 2015 @ 15:40 (UTC-0600)</code>–a three-letter capitalized month abbreviation (no period), followed by the day of the month (no leading zeroes), a comma, the four-digit year, an <code>@</code> symbol, military time, and UTC in parentheses.</li>
        <li>The only time this formatting standard would not be used is when relative dates would be helpful to the user, such as "4 hours ago" or "1 week ago".</li>
        <li>It is recommended that relative dates be reserved for more informal settings like user notes or comments. Relative dates should not extend too far into the past. For instance, "1 week ago" may be helpful to the user, but "8 months ago" or "3 years ago" is better represented by the non-relative format detailed above, as it reveals more specific information about dates that provide better context and information to the user when comparing dates and times.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="helper-classes">Helper Classes</h2>
    <div class="component-description clear">
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Subdued Text: The <code>.subdued</code> class is a basic color change to make text less prominent. The style persists if the class is nested in a link.</li>
            <li>Full Width: <code>.full-width</code> class that marks content as full width (e.g. to give a button full width). Requires 'display' to be defined as inline-block or block.</li>
            <li>Hidden content
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><code>.hidden</code> class - Will add to hide an element but not remove it from the spacing of the page.</li>
                    <li><code>.visually-hidden</code> class - Used to hide content visually but <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/clip-hidden-content-better-accessibility-53456.html">can still be read by screen readers</a> (i.e. removed from the page spacing)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Clearing floats
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><code>.clear</code> class - Provides clearfix functionality See <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/">http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack</a>.</li>
                    <li>To clear previous sibling floats, you can use the <code>.clear-left</code> and <code>.clear-right</code> classes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

    <h3 id="progress-bars">Progress Bars</h3>
    <div class="component-description clear">
        <ul class="list">
            <li>There are two states for progress bars: active and complete. Active progress bars have animated stripes, which are provided by the class <code>.active</code>. Full progress bars do not have this class, and are solid and static in appearance.</li>
            <li>Several options for displaying text with a progress bar are available: no text, a percentage (not italicized), and detailed text (italicized). Showing a percent is preferred to showing nothing. However, the more specific text is the ideal state, since it reveals both numeric progress and provides context for what progress is being tracked. See demo below.</li>
