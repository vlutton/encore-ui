        <li>This sub-site provides development teams at Rackspace with a set of design patterns, to help ensure a consistent and unified look-and-feel for all products under the Encore umbrella.</li>
        <li>This section of the Demo site focuses mainly on markup, CSS and design patterns. If you're curious about Encore-specific angular.js directives, find the "All Components" section in the left hand navigation.</li>
        <li>If you're a Rackspace team outside of Encore and need help setting up an new project from an engineering perspective, go to this <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/blob/master/guides/using-encoreui.md">Using EncoreUI In Your Own Project</a> guide in the EncoreUI repository.
        <ul class="list">
            <li>For the most part, RackSpace developer teams will be creating mark-up using the <a href="#/components/rxApp">rxPage subdirective of rxApp</a> as a container.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/blob/master/src/rxApp/templates/rxPage.html">rxPage's template code</a> contains a breadcrumb component, an attribute to pre-fill titles and subtitles and a rxNotification container so you can send page-level communication errors and validation messages in a standardized way. Check the angular.js code for controllers within Cloud Encore for implementation examples.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/tree/master/src/rxApp">rxApp</a> <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/blob/master/src/rxApp/common.less">common.less file</a> defines many base CSS rules and classes for app use. Included in this is <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a>. This helps create a consistent starting point for styles across all browsers.</li>

        <li>Kevin Lamping, a developer on the EncoreUI team, wrote a document to address <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/blob/master/guides/css-styleguide.md">coding standards while writing CSS</a>.</li>

    <h3 id="typography">Typography</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><span class="msg-info">ENCORE-SPECIFIC:</span> We use Google Fonts, in particular the Roboto font. While Google Fonts are not included in the EncoreUI package, they are included if you use the encore-ui-template repository as a base.
        <li>For developers not using encore-ui-template, <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/tree/master/src/rxApp#fonts">read the README.md file for rxApp</a> on fonts for more information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="flexbox-grid">Flexbox Grid</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Encore UI includes a grid system forked from <a target="_blank" href="https://material.angularjs.org/#/layout/container">Angular Material's layout module</a> with minor usability enhancements to provide an assortment of attribute based layout options based on the flexbox layout model. Included are intuitive attribute based styles that ease the creation of responsive row and/or column based page layouts. Visit the <a href="#/components/layout">layout</a> section for info on how to use this attributes.</li>

    <h3 id="heading-title-styles">Heading/Title Styles</h3>
    <div class="component-description clear">
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Headings are sized according to their heading level (H1 larger than H2 larger than H3, etc.).</li>
            <li><span class="msg-info">ENCORE-SPECIFIC:</span> For design consistency, we usually use an H3 heading for most subheaders. Other headings can be used for context.</li>
            <li>
              <strong class="msg-info">WARNING</strong>:
              The <code>title</code>, <code>xl</code>, <code>lg</code>, <code>sm</code>, and <code>xs</code> heading classes are deprecated and will be removed in a future release of the framework.

    <h3 id="date-formatting">Date formatting</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Dates in any context should be formatted this way: <code>Mar 2, 2015 @ 15:40 (UTC-0600)</code>–a three-letter capitalized month abbreviation (no period), followed by the day of the month (no leading zeroes), a comma, the four-digit year, an <code>@</code> symbol, military time, and UTC in parentheses.</li>
        <li>The only time this formatting standard would not be used is when relative dates would be helpful to the user, such as "4 hours ago" or "1 week ago".</li>
        <li>It is recommended that relative dates be reserved for more informal settings like user notes or comments. Relative dates should not extend too far into the past. For instance, "1 week ago" may be helpful to the user, but "8 months ago" or "3 years ago" is better represented by the non-relative format detailed above, as it reveals more specific information about dates that provide better context and information to the user when comparing dates and times.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="descriptions-metadata">Descriptions / Metadata</h3>
    <div class="component-description clear">
        <ul class="list">
            <li>The <a href="#/component/rxMetadata">rxMetadata</a> component provides the ability to display a list of terms with their associated descriptions. This is used throughout Encore to show metadata, especially on an individual object such as a server or a CBS volume.</li>
            <li><span class="msg-info">ENCORE-SPECIFIC:</span> This is an ideal solution if you have anywhere from 5-15 definitions (3 columns of 5 definitions). (See a Server Details page or Image Details page under Accounts -&gt; Cloud for an example.) Anything more - or anything displaying visual or image content - and you may want to consider a different design pattern. (See the "Non-Data based Tables" section in the Table page for more information.)</li>

    <h3 id="no-data">When There is No Data to Display</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>In table cells, metadata lists, or other displays of data, <code>N/A</code> should be used as an indicator to the user that there is no relevant data to display.</li>
        <li>Do not use <code>–</code>, <code>Empty</code>, <code>null</code>, or no indicator to communicate this, as there may be situations where those are valid inputs or data to display to a user depending on the context.</li>
        <li>Note that a separate style exists to communicate <a href="#/styleguide/basics#wells">when data isn't present due to permissions</a>, or when an entire table is empty (see "Null Patterns" section of <a href="#/styleguide/tables">Tables style guide</a>).

    <h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
    <div class="component-description clear">
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Lists by default do not have styles. Add bullets/decimals to lists with the <code>list</code> class. It is also possible to build non-semantic lists using the additional <code>item</code> class.</li>
            <li><span class="msg-info">ENCORE-SPECIFIC:</span> Use this in conjunction with icons, colors and helper classes such as <code>.flush-right</code> to build out action menus. Look at the detail pages in Cloud Servers and view-source for additional context.</li>

    <h3 id="wells">Wells</h3>
    <div class="component-description clear">
        <ul class="list">
            <li>The <code>well</code> class creates a well effect - a box with significant padding and light gray background.</li>
            <li>Three well styles are available: one for modals, one for left-aligned summary text on a full page, and one for providing an explanation as to why data is not available to the user.</li>
            <li>Modal wells: Modal wells are used in the context of modals, typically to provide a summary of data entered or decisions made by the user in a form to provide a clearer picture to the user of changes they are about to submit. Use the class <code>modal-well</code> for this type of well.</li>
            <li>Left-aligned wells: These wells are used in conjunction with forms in much the same way modal wells are utilized, except left-aligned wells appear in a full-page context. Use the class <code>well</code> for this type of well.</li>
            <li>Center-aligned wells: These wells are used to communicate why data is not present for the user, usually if data can only be seen with a permissions the user has not been granted. In other cases, it may be used to prompt the user to add data to an empty notes field. When utilizing this kind of well, list items may be appropriate. Use the classes <code>well</code> and <code>centered</code> for this type of well. Use the class <code>list</code> on a <code>ul</code> for correct styles and alignment.</li>
            <li><span class="msg-info">ENCORE-SPECIFIC:</span> In the context of Encore, we currently use this in the context of adding large amounts of extraneous or optional information.

    <div class="component-description clear">
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Subdued Text: The <code>.subdued</code> class is a basic color change to make text less prominent. The style persists if the class is nested in a link.</li>
            <li>Full Width: <code>.full-width</code> class that marks content as full width (e.g. to give a button full width). Requires 'display' to be defined as inline-block or block.</li>
            <li>Hidden content
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><code>.hidden</code> class - Will add to hide an element but not remove it from the spacing of the page.</li>
                    <li><code>.visually-hidden</code> class - Used to hide content visually but <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/clip-hidden-content-better-accessibility-53456.html">can still be read by screen readers</a> (i.e. removed from the page spacing)</li>

            <li>There are two states for progress bars: active and complete. Active progress bars have animated stripes, which are provided by the class <code>.active</code>. Full progress bars do not have this class, and are solid and static in appearance.</li>
            <li>Several options for displaying text with a progress bar are available: no text, a percentage (not italicized), and detailed text (italicized). Showing a percent is preferred to showing nothing. However, the more specific text is the ideal state, since it reveals both numeric progress and provides context for what progress is being tracked.
