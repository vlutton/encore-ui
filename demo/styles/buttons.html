<rx-page title="'Buttons &amp; Links'" class="stylguide">

    <h3 class="clear">Basics</h3>

    <p>
        You can style most of your buttons using this <code>.button</code>
        class. Exceptions can include <code>input type="button"</code> or
        <a href="#/components/rxButton">rxButton</a> for dynamic loading
        indicators.
    </p>


    <h3>Button Sizing</h3>
    <p>
        Buttons are sized using xl, lg, sm and xs classes. Not adding the
        additional class defaults the size to medium.

    <h3>Button Types & Using Color</h3>
    <p>
        <span class="msg-info">ENCORE-SPECIFIC:</span> in the context of
        EncoreUI, when is a button blue and when is it green?

        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                If the form you are submitting results in CREATING or ADDING
                something, use green.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the form you are submitting is within a modal, use green.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the form you are submitting results in EDITING something
                or something auxiliary like getting metadata from a different
                source, keep it blue.
             </li>
            <li>
                If you are providing a button for the user to continue through
                a series of modals (with no submit), use blue.
             </li>
            <li>
                If you are providing a button for the user to exit a series of
                modals where no other action is required by the user, use the
                "Finish & Close" button with a blue outline.
             </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <rx-styleguide code-url="styles/buttons/types.html"></rx-styleguide>

    <h3>Button with Animation</h3>
    <p>
        You can use the spinner style with buttons. Different spinner
        styles are used when content is loading or being fetched (see Using
        Colors and Icons With Links demo).
    </p>
    <p>
        When a user takes an action with results that can't be immediately
        displayed, a spinner is shown on a disabled button state until the call
        completes or the results of the user's action can be displayed in
        the UI. Text for your buttons with spinners should describe the action
        taken using "-ing" verbs, so the user understands why the button
        appearance has changed. The disabled state ensures the user can't
        submit the same data multiple times while the initial action completes.
    </p>
    <rx-styleguide code-url="styles/buttons/animation.html"></rx-styleguide>

    <h3>Button Groups</h3>
    <p>
        This control should NOT be used as a replacement for radio inputs.
        Instead, it should be used to indicate state on a page. For example,
        the legend of a time plot may allow the user to select a range of week,
        month, or year. In this situation, there is no form being submitted,
        but there is an indication of the graph's state that can be
        interacted with. Conversely, radio inputs are the correct way to
        implement a form input where one of a few options can be selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, this type of control should only be used with at most
        four segments.
    </p>

    <h2>Action Links</h2>

    <h3>Action Link Icons</h3>
    <p>
        To visualize and distinguish actionable items, you can use the included
        <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">
          Font Awesome
        </a>
        library. Iconography with action links remains unique to one action
        (with the exception of "create", "delete", "change", "edit", and
        "go to" actions, which use the same icons in many places regardless
        of context). However, in the case of two opposite actions that you
        can take on a single unit (for example, choosing to enable connection
        throttling on a load balancer when throttling is disabled, or disabling
        throttling when throttling is enabled), then the same icon and color
        can be used. In the case of opposite actions, only one action should
        display at a time, depending on the state. Any "enable" or "disable"
        actions should be yellow in color, as they're causing changes to
        something rather than creating something new (green) or destroying
        something (red).
    </p>
    <p>
        For the majority of Encore, actionable links are used in two
        places &mdash; in the upper right hand section of a details page,
        flushed right with the page-actions and actions-area classes, or in the
        rxActionMenu directive.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following icons have been used throughout Encore, as well as the
        actions associated with the icons. Use this as a reference for which
        icons are already in use and should not be duplicated.
    </p>
    <p>
        HEADS UP: Most icons have been chosen based on the verb (Add ,Edit,
        Delete, Restart, etc) but there are a couple of icons chosen on the
        noun (consoles, tachometers for throttling). This is a design pattern
        discrepancy that will need to be resolved in a future iteration.
    </p>

    <h2>Action Link Colors</h2>
    <p>
        Status Classes are used to provide a clearer status regarding a simple
        message. Within the context of Encore, the following colors are used
        to convey action links:
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                Green (<code>.msg-action</code>) is for create/add actions.
                When part of a list, they appear at the top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Blue (<code>.msg-info-blue</code>) is for download actions.
                When part of a list, they appear second.
            </li>
            <li>
                Orange (<code>.msg-info</code>) is for edit/modify actions.
                When part of a list, they appear third.
            </li>
            <li>
                Red (<code>.msg-warn</code>) is for destructive actions.
                When part of a list, they appear last.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Using Spinners with Action Links</h2>
    <p>
        You can use a spinner style for action links. Different spinner styles
        are available when a user takes action by clicking a button
        (see <a href="#">Buttons & Links demo</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        When an action link must first fetch data or determine state before
        the user can click it, a spinner is shown to the right of the action
        link, and both spinner and link have a disabled gray color and are
        not clickable.
    </p>
    <p>
        HEADS UP: The spinner with action link is being styled on a
        per-project basis currently, since the current implementation of
        rxSpinner needs to be updated to support this use case more easily.
